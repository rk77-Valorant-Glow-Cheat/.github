## 💡 What Is the Glow Cheat in Valorant?

The glow cheat adds a **subtle, customizable aura** to enemy players — visible even through walls, terrain, utility smokes, or flashes. It’s built to mimic Riot’s in-game outlines (like Reyna ult or Killjoy scan), so it blends in naturally.

This cheat gives you constant visual awareness **without overwhelming your screen**. It’s like running wallhack-lite — smooth, undetected, and insanely useful for clutching and pre-aiming.
